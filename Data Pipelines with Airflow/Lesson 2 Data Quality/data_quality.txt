Objective 
â€¢ Learn the concepts of data quality and how to apply them to the data pipelines in Airflow




-------------------- Data Lineage --------------------
The data lineage of a datasets describes the discrete steps involved in the creation, movement and calculation of that dataset. 
Why is data lineage important?

1. Instilling Confidence: Being able to describe the data lineage of a particular dataset or analysis will build confidence in data consumers (engineers, analysts, data scientists, etc..) that our data pipeline is creating meaningful results using the correct datasets. If the data lineage is unclear, its less likely that teh data consumers will trust or use the data.

2. Defining Metrics: Another major benefit or surfacing data lineage is that it allows everyone in the organization to agree on the definition of how a particular metric is calculated.

3. Debugging: Data lineage helps data engineers track down root errors when they occur. If each step of the data movements and transformation process is well described, its easy to find problems when they occur.

In general, data lineage has important implications for a business. Each department or business unit's success is tied to data and to the flow of data between departments. for e.g. sales departments rely on data to make sales forcats, while at the same time the finance department would need to track sales and revenue. Each of these dapartments and roles depend on data, and knowing where to find the data. Data flow and data lineage tools enable data engineers and architects to track the flow of this large web of data.
