----- DATA ENGINEERING NOTES -----

HELPFUL TIPS

- Take notes
- Write all the code yourself
- Manage your time well
- Don’t be afraid to change your schedule
- Remember.. This course is going to be HARD.
- Everyone struggles, but you need to just keep going! EVERY DAY!
- Commitment and persistence will define whether or not I will pass!
- Everyone will get stuck..
- Don’t panic
- Don’t quit
- Be patient and work through the problem.
- Udacity mentors and student spree there to help!


BLOCKERS (brain block)
2 main ways to get around it!

- Use the community for help from students that have got stuck on the same thing.
- Being able to google well!!!


ASKING QUESTIONS

- Ask specific questions: if you have more than one, use bullet points and make sure they are organised

- Provide details and links: explain what you’ve already attempted to solve the problem, include the info such as the lesson or quiz, screenshots or classroom links.

- Start with a clear question title: try and summarise the question in one sentence.

- Share code correctly: Use the ‘Code Block’ option to properly format your code, if the question is from an external piece of code, include the link.

- Figure out errors: if the question is about an error message, include the whole error message by either formatting the message using ‘Code Block’ or creating a Gist or a Paste on Pastebin and including a link to the description.

- Avoid screenshots of code or error message: screenshot text can’t be copied to debug and they can be hard to read.

- If the answer is helpful select it as the ‘accepted answer’


What is data engineering?

Data engineering comprises all engineering and operational task required to make data available for the end-user, whether its for analytics, model building, app development, etc…
(take raw data, doing work to it, deliver a clean dataset or database for whoever is going to use it)

Primarily focuses on designing efficient way of storing data, managing pipeline to move data from one place to the next and  cleaning/preparing data for the end-user.

Data storage and processing.


Common Data Engineering Activities:
- Ingest data from a data source
- Build and maintain a data warehouse
- Create a data pipeline
- Create an analytics table for specific use case
- Migrate data to the cloud
- Schedule and automate pipelines
- Backfill data
- Debug data quality issues
- Optimise queries
- Design a database


Advise for new data engineers…
Learn to use tools like:
- Airflow
- Redshift
- Spark
- Presto
Don’t try and learn them all at the start, but still try and learn as much as you can.
Try and jump in on projects that may not be in your skill set. Anything that can help you learn.
