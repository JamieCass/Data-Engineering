-------------------- LEARNING OBJECTIVE --------------------
Learn the fundamentals of data modelling for NoSQL databases, focusing on the basics of NoSQL database design, denormalization, primary keys, clustering columns and the WHERE clause.

NoSQL - Not only SQL

Non-relational database

NoSQL and non-relational are interchangeable terms.



-------------------- WHEN TO USE NoSQL --------------------

- Need high availibility in the data: Indicates the system is always up and there is no downtime.

- Have large amounts of data.

- Need linear scalability: The need to add more nodes to the system so performance will increase linearly.

- Low latency: Shorter delay before the data is transferred once the instruction for the transfer has been recieved.

- Need fast reads and write.

- Using Apache Cassandra -- a NoSQL databse



-------------------- APACHE CASSANDRA --------------------

- Open source NoSQL DB

- Masterless Architecture

- High Availibility

- Linear Scalable

- Used by Uber, Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, etc..

- Major contributors to the project: DataStax, Facebook, Twitter, Apple.



-------------------- DISTRIBULATED DATABASES --------------------
In a distributed database, in order to have high availibility, you will need copies of your data.

----- Eventual consistency -----
Over time (if no changes are made) each copy of the data will be the same, but if there are new changes, the data may be different in defferent locations. The data may be inconsisent for only milliseconds. There ae workarounds in place to revent getting stale data.

-------------------- CAP THEOREM --------------------
'C'onsistency 'A'vailibility 'P'artition tolerence

A theorem in computer science that states it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees of consistency, availibility and partition tolerence.

- Consistency: Every read from the database gets the latest (and correct) piece of data or an error.

- Availibility: Every request is recieved and a response is given -- without a guarantee that the data is the latest update.

- Partition Tolerence: The system continues to work regardless of losing network connectivity between nodes.




-------------------- DENORMALIZATION IN CASSANDRA --------------------
----- Data modelling in Apache Cassandra -----
- Denormalization is not just ok -- its a must!
- Denmormalization must be done for fast reads
- Cassandra has been optimized for fast writes
- !!!!! ALWAYS think queries first !!!!!
- One table per query is a great strategy
- Cassandra does not allow for JOINs between tables

Think... Two queries Two tables!!



-------------------- CQL --------------------
Cassandra Query Language is the way to interact with the database and is very similar to SQL. JOINS, GROUPY BY, or subqueries are not in CQL and are not supported by CQL.



-------------------- PRIMARY KEY --------------------
- The PRIMARY KEY os how each row can be uniquely identified and how the data is distributed across the nodes (or servers) in our system.

- The first element of the PRIMARY KEY is the PARTITION KEY (which will determine the distribution).

- The PRIMARY KEY is made up of either just the PARTITION KEY or with the addition of CLUSTERING COLUMNS. The PARTITION KEY will determine the distribution of data across the system.

- The partition key's row value will be hashed (turned into a number) and stored on the node in the system that holds that range of values.

----- Key Points -----
- Must be unique

- Hashing of this value results in the placement on a particular node in the system.

- The PRIMARY KEY is made up of either just the PARTITION KEY or may also include additional CLUSTERING COLUMNS

- A 'Simple' PRIMARY KEY is just one column that is also the PARTITION KEY. A 'Composite' PRIMARY KEY is made up of more than one column and will assist in creating a unique value in your retrieval queries.

- The PARTITION KEY will determine the distribution of data across the system.



-------------------- CLUSTERING COLUMNS --------------------
The PRIMARY KEY is made up of either just the PARTITION KEY or with the addition of CLUSTERING COLUMNS. The CLUSTERING COLUMN will determine the sort order within a partition.

A clustering column isnt required in the primary key. It can be used for ordering the data on the table, but its not required!

- The clustering column with sort the data in sorted ascending order, e.g. alphabetical order.

- More than one clustering column can be added (or none!)

- From thre the clustering columns will sort in order of how they were added to the primary key.

E.G. PRIMARY KEY ((year), artist_name, album_name)
If you wanted to show albums but you had some from the same year and artists you would use the PRIMARY KEY above. That will sort the 'year' frist, then the 'artist_name' and finally the 'album_name'.

YEAR 	  ARTIST_NAME 	  ALBUM_NAME
1965 	| Elvis 		| Blue hawaii
1965 	| The Beatles	| Rubber Soul
1965 	| The Beatles 	| Showing Order
1965 	| The Monkees 	| Meet the Monkees

You can see how it has been ordered with the year all being the same, but then artist name is ascedning alphabetically, then with the same artist the album name is ordered alphabetically.



-------------------- WHERE CLAUSE --------------------
- Data modelling in Cassandra is query focused and that focus needs to be on the WHERE clause.

- The PARTITION KEY must be included in your query and any CLUSTERING COLUMNS can be used in the order they appear in your PRIMARY KEY.

- Failure to include a WHERE clause will result in an error.

- Avoid using 'ALLOW FILTERING'!!!
