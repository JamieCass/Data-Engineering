-------------------- Fact and Dimension Tables --------------------

- Fact and Dimension tables are similar to ERD (entity relationship diagrams) chack the image in the folder 

- Work together to create an organized data model.

- While fact and dimension are not created differently in the DDL, the are conceptual and extremely important for organization

- Fact and Dimension tables are similar to ERD (entity relationship diagrams)

----- Fact Tables -----
- Consists of the measurements, metrics or facts of a business process

----- Dimension Tables -----
- Structure that categorizes facts and measures in order to enable users to answer business questions. Dimensions are people, products, place and time.



-------------------- Implementing Different Schemas --------------------

- Two of the most popular (because of their simplicity) data mart schea for data warehouses are:
1. Start Schema
2. Snowflake Schema



-------------------- Star Schema --------------------

Star Schema is the simplest style of data mark schemas. It consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables

----- Why 'star' schema ----- 
(Image in this folder will explain)
- Gets its name from the physical model resembling a star shape.
- A fact table in the center.
- Dimension tables surround the fact tables representing stars points.

----- Benifits -----
- Denormalized 
- Simplifies queries
- Fast aggregations

----- Drawbacks -----
- Issues that come with denormalization
- Data integrity
- Decrease query flexibility
- Many to many relationships 



-------------------- Snowlfake Schema --------------------

Logical arrangement of tables in a multidimensional database represented by centralized fact tables whoch are connected to multiple dimensions.

(look at the image in the folder (snowflake(ERD)))

----- Snowflake vs Star ----- 
- Star schema is a special, simplified case of snowflake schema.
- Star schema does not allow for one to many relationships while snowflake does.
- Snowflake is more normalized than star but only in 1NF or 2NF.
