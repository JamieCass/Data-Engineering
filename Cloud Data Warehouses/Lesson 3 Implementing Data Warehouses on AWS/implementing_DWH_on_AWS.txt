-------------------- IMPLEMENTING A DWH ON AWS --------------------
-- Choices for implementing a Data warehouse:
1. Cloud:
   	• Lower barrier to entry
   	• May add as you need - its ok to change your opinion
   	• Scalability & elasticity out of the box


2. On-Premise:
   Thik about:
   	• Heterogeneity, scalability, elasticity of the tools, technologies and processes.
   	• Need for diversse IT staff skills & multiple locatioons
   	• Cost of ownership


----- DWH Dimensional model storage on AWS -----
-- Cloud-Managed:
	• Amazon RDS (Relational Data Storage)
	• Amazon DynamoDB
	• Amazon S3
	Re-use of expertise; Less IT staff for security, upgrades, etc.. Less OpEx
	Deal with complexity with techniques like: 'Infrastructure as code'

-- Self-Managed:
	• EC2 + PostgreSQL
	• EC2 + Cassandra
	• EC2 + Unix FS
	Always 'catch-all' option if needed
