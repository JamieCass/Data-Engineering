-------------------- CLOUD COMPUTING --------------------
--- Cloud computing: The practice of using a networks of remote servers hosted in the internet to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or  personal computer.

Advantages:
• Eliminate need to invest in costly hardware upfront
• Repidly provision resources
• Provide efficient global access

--- AWS: We will be using AWS during a lot of the course, mainly Redshift and S3.

--- Redshift Cluster ---
- IAM Role (myRedshiftRole)
- Security gorup (redshift_security_group)
- Create cluster in redshift:
	• Cluster identifier: redshift-cluster
	• Database name: dev
	• Database port: 5439
	• Master user name: awsuser
	• Master user password and confirm password: enter a password
- Additional Configuration:
	• VPC security groups: redshift_security_group
	• Available IAM roles: myRedshiftRole

--- S3 Bucket ---
- Create  bucket : unique bucket name
- Upload files to bucket: add files

--- PostgreSQL DB using RDS ---
- Amazon RDS console
- Create DB
- PostgreSQL
- Demonstation purposes: Dev/Test under Use case
- DB Details page: Leave everything default, only chnage DB instance class: db.t2.small
- DB instance indentifier: postgreSQL-test or any name of your choice
- Enter master username and pw
- Leave everything as default 
- Backup: 1 day for demonstation purposes.

-------------------- Key recommendations --------------------
- Delete your Amazon Redshft cluster each time youre finished working with it.
- Use a smaller subset of your data while you code and debug on AWS. Only execute with the full dataset on AWS as a final test of your code.
