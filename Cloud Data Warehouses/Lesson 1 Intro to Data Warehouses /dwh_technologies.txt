The Last Mile: Delivering the analytics to users

Data is available...
• In an understandable & performant dimensional model
• With conformed dimensions or seperate data marts
• For users to report and visualize
	• By interacting directly with the model
	• Or in most cases, through a BI application


-------------------- OLAP CUBES TECHNOLOGY --------------------
OLAP cubes is a very convenient way for slicing, dicing and drilling-down

How do we serve these OLAP cubes?
• Approach 1: Pre-aggregate the OLAP cubes and saves them on a special purpose non-relational database (MOLAP)
• Approach 2: Compute the OLAP cubes on the fly from the existing relational databases where the dimensional model resides (ROLAP)

Demo: Column format in ROLAP
• Use the postgresql with a columnar table extension
• Load a dataset in a normal table
• Load the same dataset in a columnar table
• Compare the performance of the fact-aggregating query performance in both tables
