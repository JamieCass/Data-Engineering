-------------------- OLAP CUBES --------------------
- An OLAP cube is an aggregation of a fact metric on a number of dimensions
- E.g. Movie, Branch, Month
- Easy to communicate to business users
- Common OLAP operations include: Roll-up, drill-down, slice & dice



-------------------- Roll-up & Drill-down --------------------
----- Roll-up -----
Sum up the sales of each city by Country: e.g. US, France (less columns in branch dimensions)

----- Drill-down -----
Decompose the sales of each city into smaller districts (more columns in branch dimension)

- The OLAP cube should store the finest grain of data (atomic data), in case we need to drill down to the lowest level: e.g. Country -> City -> District -> Street, etc...



-------------------- Slice & Dice --------------------
----- Slice -----
- Reducing N dimensions to N-1 dimensions by restricting one dimension to a single value
- e.g. month = 'MAR'

----- Dice -----
- Same dimensions but computing a sub-cube by restricting some of the values of the dimension
- e.g. month in ['FEB','MAR'] and movie in ['Avatar','Batman'] branch = 'NY'



-------------------- Query Optimization --------------------
- Business users will typically want to slice, dice, roll-up and drill-down all the time.

- Each such combination will potentially go through all the facts table (suboptimal)

- The 'GROUP by CUBE (movie, branch, month)' will make one pass through the facts table and will aggregate all possible combinations of groupings, of length 0, 1, 2 and 3 e.g.:
• Total revenue 	• Revenue by movie 		• Revenue by movie, branch 		• Revenue by movie, branch, month
					• Revenue by branch 	• Revenue by branch, month
					• Revenue by month 		• Revenue by month, movie

- Saving/Materializing the output of the CUBE operation and using it is usually enough to answer all forthcoming aggregations from business users without having to process the whole facts table again.
