Back Room (Perparing)
---------------------
ETL Systems:
- Transform from source to target
- Conform dimensions
- No user query support

Front Room (End user)
---------------------
Presentation Area:
- Dimensional
- Atomic & summary data
- Organized by business process
- Usses conformed dimensions

Design Goals:
- Ease of use
- Query performance

Applications:
- Ad hoc queries
- Standard reports
- Analytic apps

Kimball's Bus Architecture, data is kept in a common dimension data model shared across different departments. It does not allow for individual department specific data modeling requirements.



-------------------- Independant Data Marts --------------------
Back Room (Preparing)
---------------------
ETL Systems:
- Each department alone has its own seperate ETL process

Front Room (End user)
---------------------
- Department 1 Data mart 
- Department 2 Data mart
- Department 3 Data mart

- Department 1 application
- Department 2 application
- Department 3 application

• Departments have independant ETL processes & dimenson models
• These seperate& smaller dimensional models are called 'Data Marts'
• Different fact tables for the same events, no conformed dimensions
• Uncoordinated efforts can led to inconsistent views
• Despite awareness of the emergence of this architecture from departmental autonomy, it is generally discouraged

• 2 ETL processes
	- Source systems -> 3NF DB
	- 3NF DB -> Departmental data marts
• The 3NF DB acts as an enterprise wide data store.
	- Single integrated source of truth for data marts
	- Could be accessed by end-users if needed
• Data marts dimensionally modelled & unlike Kimballs dimensional models, they are mostly aggregated.

Corporate Information Factory (CIF) build on a 3NF normalized database and then allow for documented data denormalization for Data Marts.
