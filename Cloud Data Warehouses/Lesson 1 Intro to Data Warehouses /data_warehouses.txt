-------------------- DATA WAREHOUSES  (BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE) --------------------

A data warehouse is designed to optimize data analysis and gathers data from multiple sources.


E.G. 
You are in charge of a retialers infastructure. This is what you have to look at!!!...

----- Business Activities -----

- Customers: should be able to find goods and make orders

- Inventory Staff: should be able to stock, retrieve and re-order goods

- Delivery Staff: should be able to pick up & deliver goods

- HR: should be able to assess the performance of sales channels

- Marketing: should be able to see the effect of different sales channels

- Management: should be able to monitor sales growth

ASK YOURSELF: 
Can i build a database to support these activities? 
Are all of the above questions of the same nature?


----- Details that may affect your data infastructure -----

- Retailer has a nation-wide presence -> 'Scale?'

- Retailer has aquired smaller retailers, brick & mortar shops, online store -> 'Single database? Complexity?'

- Has support call center & socail media accounts -> 'Tabular data?'

- Customers, Inventory Staff and Delivery Staff expect the system to be fast & stable -> 'Performance'

- HR, Marketing & Sales Reports want a lot of information but have not decided yet on everything they need -> 'Clear Requirements?'

MAYBE A SINGLE REATIONAL DATABASE WONT SUFFICE!!!! 



-------------------- OPERATIONAL VS ANALYTICAL PROCESSES --------------------

----- Operational Processes (make it work!) ----- 

- Find goods & make orders (customers)

- Stock and find goods (inverntory staff)

- Pick up and deliver goods (delivery staff)


----- Analytical Processes (whats going on?) ----- 

- Assess the performance or sales staff (HR)

- See the effect of differnt sales channelks (marketing)

- Monitor sales growth (management)


----- Opertational Databases -----
GOOD...
- Excellent for operations

- No redudency , high integrity

BAD...
-- Too slow for analytics, too many joins

-- Too hard to undertsand


----- Solution -----

Create 2 processing models, Create a system for them to co-exist

OLTP: Online Transactional Processing

OLAP: Online Analytical Processing

Data Warehouse: A system (including processes, technologies & data representations) that enable us to support analytical processes



-------------------- DATA WAREHOUSES  (TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE) --------------------

DWH Definition 1
A data warehouse is a copy of tramsaction data specifically structured for query and analysis.

DWH Definition 2
A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrted, nonvolitile and time-variant collection of data in support of managements descisions.

DWH Definition 3
A data warehouse is a system that retrieve and consolidates data periodically from the source systems into a dimensional or normalized data store. It usually keeps years of history and is queried for business intelligence or other analytical activities. It is tyoically uodatedd in batches, not every time a transaction happens in the source system.


----- Data warehouse goals -----

- Simple to understand

- Performant

- Quality assured

- Handles new questions well

- Secure



-------------------- DIMENSIONAL MODELING --------------------

STAR SCHEMA (joins with dimensions only, good for OLAP not OLTP)

3NF SCHEMA (lots of expensive joins, hard to explain to business users)

----- Fact Tables ----- (Usually NUMERIC & ADDITIVE)

- Record business events like an order, a phone call, a book review.

- Fact tables columns record events recorded in quantifiable metrics like quantity of an item, duration of a call or a book rating.


--- EXAMPLES FACTS ---

- A comment on an article represents an event but we can not easily make a statistic out of its content per se (NOT a GOOD fact)

- Invoice number is numerical but adding it does not make sense (NOT a GOOD fact)

- Total amount of an invoice could be added to complete total sales (GOOD fact)


----- Dimension Tables ----- (Usually PHYSICAL (staff/customers/store/ etc..))

- Record the context of the business events, e.g. who, what, where, why etc..

- Dimension tables columns contain attributes like the store at which an item is purchased or the customer who made the call etc..


--- EXAMPLE DIMENSIONS ---

- Date & time are always a dimension

- Physical locations and their attributes are GOOD candidates for dimensions

- Human roles like customers and staff are always GOOD candidates for dimensions

- Goods sold are always GOOD candudates for dimensions
