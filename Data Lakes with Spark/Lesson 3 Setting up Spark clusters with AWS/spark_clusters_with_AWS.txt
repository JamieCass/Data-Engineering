-------------------- Spark Clusters with AWS --------------------
----- Overview -----
By the end of the lesson, we will be able to
• Distinguish between setting up a Spark cluster using both local and standalone mode
• Set up Spark cluster on AWS
• User Spark UI
• Use AWS CLI
• Create EMR  using AWS CLI
• Create EMR cliuster
• Test port forwarding
• Use notebooks on your Spark cluster
• Write Spark scripts
• Store and retrieve data on the cloud
• Read and write to Amazon S3 
• Understand the distinction between HDFS and S3 
• Reading and writing data to HDFS




 --------------------  From Local to Standalone Mode --------------------
- Spark Cluster Managers
	• Standalone mode (we will be doing this)
	• MESOS (for sharing with a whole team of engineers and analysts)
	• YARN (for sharing with a whole team of engineers and analysts)

----- Overview of setting up a Spark cluster -----
1. Amazon S3 will store the dataset
2. We rent a cluster of machines, i.e our Spark cluster and its located in AWS data centers. We rent these using AWS service called Elastic Compute CLoud (EC2)
3. We log in from our local machine to this Spark cluster
4. Upon running our Spark code, the cluster will load the dataset from S3 into our clusters memory distributed across each machine in the cluster

----- New Terms -----
• Local mode: You are running a Spark program on your laptop like a single machine
• Standalone mode: You are defining Spark Primary and Secondary to work on your (virtual) machine. You can do this on EMR or your machine. Standalone modes uses a resource managaer like YARN or MESOS


								 --------- EC2 vs EMR ---------
						AWS EMR							AWS EC2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distributed computing	Yes								Yes

Node categorization		Categorizes secondary nodes 	Does not use node 
						into core and task nodes as 	categorization
						a result of which data can be 
						lost in case a data node is 
						removed.

Can support HDFS?		Yes								Only if you 																configure HDFS on 															EC2 yourself using 															multi-step process.

What protocol can 		Uses S3 protocol over AWS S3, 	ECS uses s3a
be used?				which is faster than s3a 
						protocol	

Comparison cost			Bit higher						Lower


 aws emr create-cluster --name 'my test cluster' --use-default-roles --release-label emr-5.28.0 --instance-count 3 --applications Name=Spark --ec2-attributes KeyName='testkey' --instance-type m5.xlarge --instance-count 3 --auto-terminate
